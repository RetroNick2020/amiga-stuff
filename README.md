# Amiga Stuff

## Description

A random collection of my Amiga related programs, mostly written for AmigaOS
on classic Motorola 68k hardware. This is for the purpose of learning
and sharing with other programmers in the Amiga community, so we can
spread an improve the understanding in order to write better software
for our platforms.

Since I have number of classic Amiga, AmigaOS 4, MorphOS and AROS machines spread
around my house, I figured I should put them to good use, deepen my understanding
of these systems and improve my C and general programming skills.

The C code was developed with the VBCC and gcc compilers on a GNU/Linux system using
the C99 setting.

I think that cross-compiling is the most effective way to program the
Amiga - commodity systems for development, vintage custom systems for
deployment.

There are also scripts in Python, Racket or Scala for certain tools that prepare
and process data.
