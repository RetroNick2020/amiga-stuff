# Amiga Stuff

## Description

A random collection of my Amiga related programs, mostly written for AmigaOS
on classic Motorola 68k hardware.

Since I have 9 Amiga computers of various models (1000, 500, 1200, 4000)
spread around my house, I figured I should put them to good use. It also
has the nice side-effect that I learn to develop for AROS, AmigaOS 4.x and
MorphOS as well.

Most code was developed with the VBCC compiler on a GNU/Linux system,
but I might add builds for GCC and SAS/C when it makes sense.

I think that cross-compiling is the most effective way to program the
Amiga - commodity systems for development, vintage custom systems for
deployment.

Might contain scripts in Python, Racket or Scala for certain tools, since
these are my current tools of choice.
