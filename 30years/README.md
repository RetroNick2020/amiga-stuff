## Description

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Amiga, I decided to write a couple of
small applications that run on classic Amiga computers. The point ? Does there
need to be one ? The Amiga was a fun machine, programming it was fun and
it still is.

Another goal is to practice Amiga OS development using only free software tools and
libraries (the exception being the OS itself) and gain a deeper understanding
of the system.

## System Requirements

The software was developed on a GNU/Linux system with VBCC and GNU make.
It was mostly deployed and tested on FS-UAE.

I am certain it can be built on different systems, however this will
require modifications.

## Building 

The software was developed on VBCC and apart from VBCC and NDK, there are no other
dependencies.

Currently, on a correctly set up development system typing

```
make
```

should just work.

### Status

In progress :)

## Current applications

  * intuitoy1 - experiments with Intuition (Kickstart 1.x)
  * iffview - a simple IFF viewer
