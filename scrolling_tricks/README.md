# Scrolling Tricks

This is a project to rework the Aminet Scrolling Tricks by Georg Steger into a
version that has higher internal reuse, is smaller and compiles with
VBCC. The purpose is mainly to better understand the algorithms

# System Requirements

This software requires V39 libraries and therefore only runs on the
3.x releases or greater of AmigaOS
