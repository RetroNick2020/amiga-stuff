## Utilities

### decode_cloanto_rom.py

Turns a Cloanto ROM into a regular Amiga ROM image. Useful e.g. when you have
an emulator/machine that can't read Cloanto ROMs directly. WinUAE has this
built in.

### png2image.py

Converts a PNG image into a AmigaOS Image structure that can be used directly
in Intuition programs.
