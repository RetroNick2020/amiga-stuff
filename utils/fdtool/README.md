# FDTool

## Description

This is a Python script to explore the FD format. My intention was to make
something similar to fd2pragma, but targetting my Amiga Lisp project.
fd2pragma is a whopping 13000+ lines, but it is written in C and has a lot
of features and no external dependencies.

I started with Python to cut down on development time (doing tons of Python
these days), but might switch to Lisp/Racket at a later point in time so I can run
it on an Amiga system.
